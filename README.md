# iOS Audio Appending Recorder Example

This app uses Core Audio and AVAudioEngine to record and then continue recording (append-record) to a CAF audio file.

## To test:
1. Use Xcode to build and install the app onto your iOS device
2. Tap the buttons to interact with the app

Most of the work is done in the `AudioAppendingRecorder.h/m` files.
